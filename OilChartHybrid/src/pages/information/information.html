    <h3>Crude Oil Pricing Forecast Index (OPF Index)</h3>
    <p class="question">Have you ever wondered what the price of oil would be in the future?</p>
    <p>Of course you have! Especially in the current market.</p>
    <p class="question">How could you plan for the future?</p>
    <p>You could consult your magic 8-ball; you could follow your ‘gut’; you could run complex production and demand models; or you could hire a consulting firm; but most of us look outside for what market experts are forecasting.</p>
    <p>The Crude Oil Pricing Forecast Index (OPF Index) is the remarkably simple tool designed to answer all those questions.</p>
    <p>The OPF Index does all the data aggregation from thousands of sources, qualifies their predictions, ranks their past accuracy and presents a single unified weighted index made up of thousands of predictions from hundreds of forecasters.</p>
    <p class="question">The result?</p>
    <p>A forecasting index that has proven to be more accurate than any single forecaster in predicting the future price of oil.</p>
